# FlagChecker
Old project that allows user to check how many countries he has visited so far. After selecting flags of countries that user has visited,
he proceeds to the summary which displays a colored map as well as many facts & details with the posibility to share with friends via link.
It was basically a training of using dependency injection, unit tests, mocking, multi-language resources and some other stuff - plus
I wanted to know how many countries I have visited since travelling is also my second hobby (:
